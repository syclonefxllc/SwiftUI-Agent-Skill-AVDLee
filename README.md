Expert guidance for any AI coding tool that supports the [Agent Skills open format](https://agentskills.io/home) — SwiftUI state management, view composition, performance, and iOS 26+ Liquid Glass adoption.

This repository distills practical SwiftUI best practices into actionable, concise references for agents and code review workflows.

## Who this is for
- Teams adopting modern SwiftUI APIs who want quick, correct defaults
- Developers reviewing or refactoring SwiftUI views and data flow
- Anyone shipping performant lists, scrolling, sheets, and navigation in SwiftUI

## How to Use This Skill

### Option A: Using skills.sh
Install this skill with a single command:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/avdlee/swiftui-agent-skill --skill swiftui-expert-skill
```

For more information, [visit the skills.sh platform page](https://skills.sh/avdlee/swiftui-agent-skill/swiftui-expert-skill).

Then use the skill in your AI agent, for example:
> Use the swiftui expert skill and review the current SwiftUI code for state-management and performance improvements

### Option B: Claude Code Plugin

#### Personal Usage
To install this Skill for your personal use in Claude Code:

1. Add the marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill
```

2. Install the Skill:

```bash
/plugin install swiftui-expert@swiftui-expert-skill
```

### Option C: Cursor plugin (coming soon)
This repository is now packaged for Cursor plugin submission, but the marketplace listing is not live yet.

Once approved, you'll be able to install it from the Cursor Marketplace.

#### Project Configuration
To automatically provide this Skill to everyone working in a repository, configure the repository's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "swiftui-expert@swiftui-expert-skill": true
  },
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "swiftui-expert-skill": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "AvdLee/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When team members open the project, Claude Code will prompt them to install the Skill.

### Option D: Codex / OpenAI-compatible tools
This repository includes an `agents/openai.yaml` manifest. Copy or symlink the `swiftui-expert-skill/` folder into your Codex skills directory:

```bash
cp -R swiftui-expert-skill/ "$CODEX_HOME/skills/swiftui-expert-skill"
```

See [Codex skills documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/) for details on where to save skills.

### Option E: Manual install
1) **Clone** this repository.
2) **Install or symlink** the `swiftui-expert-skill/` folder following your tool’s official skills installation docs (see links below).
3) **Use your AI tool** as usual and ask it to use the “swiftui-expert” skill for SwiftUI tasks.

#### Where to Save Skills
Follow your tool’s official documentation, here are a few popular ones:
- **Codex:** [Where to save skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/#where-to-save-skills)
- **Claude:** [Using Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview)
- **Cursor:** [Plugins documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins) or [Enabling Skills](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills#enabling-skills)

**How to verify**:

Your agent should reference the workflow/checklists in `swiftui-expert-skill/SKILL.md` and jump into the relevant reference file for your task.

## What's Inside

This skill covers the full surface of SwiftUI development -- from state management and view composition to Swift Charts, macOS multi-window scenes, animations, and iOS 26+ Liquid Glass -- without bloating your agent's task context. Reference files load on demand, so your agent gets deep guidance only for the topic at hand.

- **State management** -- property wrapper selection, `@Observable`, data flow patterns
- **View composition** -- extraction patterns, container views, identity stability
- **Performance** -- hot-path optimization, lazy loading, `@Observable` granularity
- **Lists & ForEach** -- stable identity, Table, inline filtering pitfalls
- **Navigation & sheets** -- NavigationStack, NavigationSplitView, Inspector, enum-based sheets
- **Swift Charts** -- marks, axes, selection, styling, accessibility, Chart3D
- **Animations** -- implicit/explicit, transitions, phase/keyframe, `@Animatable` macro
- **macOS** -- scenes, window styling, Table, HSplitView, AppKit interop
- **Liquid Glass** -- iOS 26+ glass effects, containers, fallback patterns
- **Accessibility** -- VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, grouping, traits
- **Image optimization** -- AsyncImage, downsampling, caching
- **Latest APIs** -- deprecated-to-modern migration guide (iOS 15+ through iOS 26+)

Non-opinionated: focuses on correctness and performance, not architecture or code style.

## Maintenance

The repository includes a maintenance skill for keeping API guidance current:

```text
.agents/skills/update-swiftui-apis/
  SKILL.md               - Workflow for scanning Apple docs and updating latest-apis.md
  references/
    scan-manifest.md     - Categorized API areas, doc paths, and search queries to scan
```

Use this skill after new iOS or Xcode releases to refresh the deprecated API reference. It requires the [Sosumi MCP](https://github.com/kanaa257/sosumi.ai) to be available. See `AGENTS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

Note: only `swiftui-expert-skill` is intended to be published in the Cursor plugin. The maintenance skill remains a repository workflow utility.
